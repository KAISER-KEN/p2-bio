		<h3>Bio</h3>
       <hr>
			<p>Hello everyone! I am Kenzo! I am originally come from Osaka, Japan.<br>I go to Eastern Washington University to get the Bachelor in Visual Communication Design. I have been working hard since I started studying.<br>When I was a little, I lived in Spokane for a year with my family. My father needed to help his friend who used to work at Whitworth University. My dad is a Physical Education Professor at his university in Japan now.<br> From that experience, I wanted to go back to Spokane, so I decided to come back here! In the future, I want to work at Game Industry to design something new stuff, or create some 3D modelings!</p>
